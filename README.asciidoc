Raison D'etre
-------------
Having used countless programs from the commandline, the lack of user friendliness has always been frustrating, as well as the amount of boilerplate that would be copy/pasted from other projects to handle the very basic task of telling a user how to use the program, and what version of the program they're using is. I came across various projects for handling arguments, but none for help/version dialogue specifically, let alone in the many various programming languages that one may use. In many popular projects, simply trying to get usage help is a roll of the dice as to what argument works (nano doesn't support "help", openssl and gcc _only_ support "help" and "--help" respectively, etc.), and are usually case-sensitive which is not user friendly. Even Python's argparse throws "unrecognized arguments" unless you use "--help".

This library isn't meant to be another argparse or a derivative, but a one-file library to accomplish the simple task of outputting help dialogue and/or version information in numerous languages. You may also configure whether or not such info will be outputted if no arguments are given, or to disable matching of some arguments that may conflict with other program flags such as -h or -v.

Usage
------
Only one function call is required after importing/including the respective language's Help-Handler file. Most users will only be concerned with the _config()_ function to enable/disable matching of arguments which might conflict with your program (h, -h, --h, v, -v, --v), and _version()_ to pass your program's version.

You can refer to the readme and _examples_ folder in each respective language's folder for basic and more advanced usage, though there are few functions.
